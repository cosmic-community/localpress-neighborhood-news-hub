## Original Prompt

This application was built based on the following request:

> Build a modern, clean, and simple news-aggregating website. The homepage should ask the user to enter their zip code. Once entered, the site should pull and display a feed of free, publicly available news articles relevant to that zip code. Organize the news by topic (e.g. local news, events, crime, politics, weather). Include a "Tip This Site" button on every page so users can send a small donation (integrate a simple payment method like Stripe or Buy Me a Coffee). The site should have: A responsive design that looks great on mobile and desktop, A clear, friendly headline and subheadline on the homepage, A loading animation while news is being fetched, A fallback message if no news is available for a zip code, A footer with simple navigation: About, Contact, Privacy Policy, An optional email sign-up form to be notified of new local headlines. Keep the design modern, clean, and user-friendly â€” like a cross between Apple News and a neighborhood bulletin board.

The app has been tailored to work with your existing Cosmic content structure and includes all the features requested above.
